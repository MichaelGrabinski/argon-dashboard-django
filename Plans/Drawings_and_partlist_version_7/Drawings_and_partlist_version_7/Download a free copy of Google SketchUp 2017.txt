Sketchup is an expencive software to buy. SketchUp Make was still free untill 2017. The links are taken down to that version and im not alowed to give you 
any links to find the software but if you search for "sketchupmake-2017-2-2555-90782-en-x64.exe" then the first result (/archive.org) is a working version 
of Sketchup 2017 that you can download and install. I use that version for all my drawings. The software gives you a 30 day trial of the PRO version and 
then it switches over to "Make" version, that is good enough to draw in and totaly free. 

You can also download a 30 day trial from Sketchup or use their free web based version.
